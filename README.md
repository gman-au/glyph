### Glyph - a logic puzzle game for Android devices

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Be advised - this code is **old**! 

* The premise is very simple - each puzzle is comprised of a set of switches on the left, and some light bulbs on the right.
* In between are a set of logically operated components, essentially a 'logic circuit'.
* Use the switches to solve the puzzle; each component responds to certain inputs with certain outputs.
* A tutorial mode is included, as well as support for several other languages.
* A level editor is included, but is currently broken as the app was originally designed for [phones with the menu button](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/140699628#comment6).
